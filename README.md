# JCR-Consulting-Website 

This is a website that I wrote for a client for their personal consulting firm. The web page was initially written without a Javascript framework, consisting of mostly vanilla HTML and PHP with some light Javscript mixed in. 

I decided, in order to make the page more responsive, to rewrite the application in Angular2. The live version of the website is up for all to see at:
