            “I have known Jack for several years, first from his publications and in the last five years from joint research projects and from personal contacts. He is an outstanding scientist with a deep understanding of both computational and experimental structures, mechanics and biomechanics in particular. He has used these skills to analyze injury biomechanics and to develop better personal protective armor for soldiers exposed to explosion blasts and ballistic impacts. We have worked together on the development of computational models, namely blast brain and thoracic injury focusing on biomechanics of primary traumatic brain injury (TBI)mechanisms........” LinkedIn

            “Jack is an innovative and highly accomplished engineer and effective program manager. This has been recognized by his appointment to the Principal Professional Staff of JHU/APL and his being made an ASME Fellow. Jack has been particularly instrumental in the establishment of a whole body of work conducted at JHU/APL on the characterization of injury thresholds for ballistic impact and blast interacting with the human body through protective gear. In addition, he has developed and patented technologies for advanced composite prosthetic implants for intermedullary bone repair. He is an internationally recognized authority on the development of an advanced anthropometric test devices for measuring the energy transmission through the human torso, neck and brain imparted by ballistic impact and blast through personal protective systems like body armor.......” LinkedIn
